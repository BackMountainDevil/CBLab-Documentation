Installation
==================

CBEngine is packed as a python package `cbengine` and can be imported in python with:

.. code-block::

    import cbengine

CBEngine provides two approaches for installation: with docker and with source code. 
We highly recommend to use our docker for CBEngine

Using docker
------------------
Pull our docker image of CBLab:

.. code-block::

    docker pull huangzherui/cbengine:latest

Create a container with the docker image. */path/to/your/folder* is the path of folder containing
scripts and data for running the simulation:

.. code-block::

    docker run -it -v /path/to/your/CBLab_files:/CBLab_files huangzherui/open-engine:latest bash


Now, start up the simulation in the container.


Using source code
------------------
Our `source code <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v0A8QnuWQNqn8zDh3TXL69AIJmwVEspv/view?usp=sharing>`_ is available for Linux. To install CBEngine, unzip the file and 
run the following command in the 'CBLab/CBEngine/' folder:

.. code-block::

    cd ./core
    pip install -e ./

The installation will finish in seconds.

For installation with source code, we recommend you to create a new environment as follows:

- Enter the folder 'CBLab/'
- Run following commands:

.. code-block::

    conda create -n cblab python=3.8
	conda activate cblab
	pip install -r requirments.txt


Test the installation
---------------------

We provide our test 
- Enter the folder 'CBLab/CBEngine/test/'
- Run the following command: `python main.py`
- If it outputs as follows, the installation is successfully completed:

.. code-block::
